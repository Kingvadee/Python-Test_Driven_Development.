Multiple IF Statement in Python.
Quick Hint: use ./run-file to run the test for the program.

-The idea of the run-file program is to: impliment the use of multiple IF Statement to write a program that takes input from the user and also prints output to the user.
STEPS TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
	{
		>Collect Height value from user(it has to be in meters and of type float, e.g 1.6)
		>Collect Weight value from user(it has to be in kilogram(KG)of type int, e.g 40)
		>The program then uses the user's input to calcilate the BMI(Body Mass Index)of the user.
		>When the user's BMI is below 20, then it allows the user to ride the Carousel else it will prompt the user that they are over-weight hence cannot ride the carousel.
		>Again this program will collect age value from user(it has to be of type int, e.g 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9...)
		>The program displays user's age, followed by a message for the required amount to be paid to be able to ride the Carousel(amount to be paid is determined by user's age)
		>Again for the last time in the program, user will be asked if the need a photograph during the ride or not
		>If user does not want a photograph during the ride then the program automatically prints amount to be paid for the ride else,
		>It will add up extra  charges for the photograph and then prints the Subtotal amount to be paid for both the ride and the photograph,followed by a message that says "Enjoy Your Ride!"
		>the program ends automatically.
